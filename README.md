# Wanna-be-papa

A simple malware deployment protocol. Use strictly in authorized environments for penetration testing or educational simulation.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Download Required Packages**  
   Choose and install the packages necessary for your target environment.

2. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   https://github.com/muhammad-khalid-bin-walid/Wanna-be-papa.git
   ```

3. **Run the Server Script**  
   Launch the server-side script to initialize the injector environment.

4. **Select Injector Mode**

5. **Specify Script Location**  
   Define the path to your target script for injection.

   Ensure the script path is correctly mapped for deployment.

7. **Deploy via rsync**  
   ```bash
   rsync -avz ./payload user@target:/path/to/deploy

Let me know if you want to modularize this into a simulation-ready framework or wrap it with logging, rollback, or sandbox protocols.
